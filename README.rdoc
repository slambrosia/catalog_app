<h2>Catalogue Application</h2>

his is a practice and Test application for learning Rails 4.

Intended to track and catalog a collection of items.

I'll be making weekly(hopefully) updates to the app adding new views and models. This is nothing fancy, just a quick app to test out code writing and learn the insides of Rails 4.
